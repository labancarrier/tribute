<p id="tribute-info">The All-Star game was the idea of Arch Ward, sports editor of the Chicago Tribune, who proposed that the best players from the American and National leagues take part in a one-off game at Chicago’s Comiskey Park while the city was hosting the 1933 World’s Fair, the Century of Progress Exposition.

“By the 1930s, baseball had already established itself as America's favorite pastime,” writes Baseball Almanac, “and the national exposition provided the perfect stage to introduce baseball's best to the rest of the country.”

The game, dubbed “The Game of the Century,” was scheduled for July 6, a day when both leagues had no games scheduled. Retired Giants manager John McGraw was chosen to manage the National League, while Athletics manager Connie Mack led the American League.

“There were 47,595 fans in the stands, all eager to see a novel concept in action—action that would be performed by the most glittering assemblage of ballplaying talent ever brought together on the diamond at one time,” describes The Sporting News. here was one player in particular who excited fans and players alike. “We wanted to see the Babe,” said NL starting pitcher Bill Hallahan. “Sure, he was old and had a big waistline, but that didn't make any difference. We were on the same field as Babe Ruth.”

The first run was scored in the second inning, when AL starting pitcher Lefty Gomez drove in Jimmie Dykes with a single. In the next inning, Ruth gave fans what they came to see, hitting a two-run homer into the right-field stands. The crowd were said to have “roared in acclamation” for the homer, according to Baseball Almanac.

The AL went on the win the game 4-2, but, more importantly, the event was a financial and popular success. Initially envisioned as a one-time event, an All-Star game has been played every summer since its founding, with the exception of 1945. </p>
